# handwritten_digits_and_alphabets_recognition

In this project we tried to detect handwritten digits and alphabets and recognize them correctly using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

Contents :-
	1. Datasets - Dataset for training the model for digits recognition. Dataset here used is the MNIST dataset.
	2. A_Z_Handwritten_Data.zip - Dataset for training the model for uppercase alphabets recognition. Dataset here used is the Char74K dataset in ‘.csv’ format.
	3. A_Z_model.py - Python script for training and saving the model for uppercase alphabets recognition.
	4. cnn_model.py - Python script for training and saving the model for digits recognition.
	5. digits_v1.h5 - saved model for digits recognition which can be used in test.py file for testing the model on images.
	6. alphabets.h5 - saved model for uppercase alphabets recognition which can be used in test.py file to test the model on images.
	7. test.py - Python script for testing the trained models on images and displaying the results.
	8. dataset_creation.py - One can also create their own dataset through this python script.
	9. img.jpg - test image
	10. example.jpg - sample image for creating your own dataset which is loaded in dataset_creation.py to process it and save various digits and alphabets in the image.
